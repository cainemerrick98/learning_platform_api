# Learning Platform

This is a personal project. 

Its a web app that combines a Pdf reader, a code editor, a markdown editor and AI to create a platform made for learning. 

You should be able to read a textbook and answer the exercises using markdown or code. 

The AI coach should be able:
- evaluate your answers to exercises and suggest area for improvement
- to help you with exercises by giving you hints and topics to explore
- create exercises from text
- create exercises or recommend reading for deeper exploration
